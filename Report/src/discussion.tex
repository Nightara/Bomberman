In our opinion, the governor approach we took for our primary submission has a lot of potential.
We already pointed out some of its advantages over a monolithic implementation in chapter~\ref{sec:design}, but we would
also show some of its flaws here, and how we tried to avoid them:

First and foremost, the governor only works as the sum of all of its parts.
If one part is broken or even missing, it is nearly impossible to achieve meaningful results.
In our case, the central element of Bomberman was survival: Without a surviving agent, we can't use bombs, move around,
collect coins, or do anything the other sub-agents are supposed to do.
But this also goes for other synergies: There is no point in collecting coins if we can't create any, and there is no
point in finding a path to the nearest opponent if there are crates blocking the way, making it impossible to move.
To circumvent this issue, we took two different approaches:
In some cases, like the survivor, we created a static, rule-based alternative for the \gls{ml} agent, who would stand in
for the actual agent until it was ready, allowing us to train everything in parallel without having to wait for the
other subtasks to complete (Which would defeat one of the main goals of this approach).
In other cases, like the coin collection and bombing agents, we simply decided to merge these two tasks, as they were
too closely related to effectively split them up, and train them together as a single sub-agent.
This approach does go against the general concept of our agent design, but we decided to take these steps in favor of
time and simplicity.
With more time at our hands, we probably could have introduced even more tasks and split up the existing ones even
further to allow for a more fine-grained control over our agent.

If split up sufficiently, this approach could easily be used to customize the agent for whatever purpose it should
fulfill: Increase the weight of a bombing sub-agent to increase the agent's level of aggression, decrease the priority
of the survivor to allow for riskier maneuvers, increase the priority of collecting coins over destroying opponents,
etc.

We could even take this concept even further and change our weights (Which can be seen as meta parameters for our model)
to change over the course of a game depending on certain factors like number of opponents, our current standing, etc.
Finally, the governor itself could be implemented as some sort of simple \gls{ml} algorithm, with its weights being the
parameters adjusted based on training data.
Based on our experience with our agent training so far though, it would most likely require an unjustifiable amount of
training data to even get decent results for such a complex agent - even if we assume the sub-agents to be fully trained
already.
